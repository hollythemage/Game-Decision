=head1 Description

A Statistics package of Decision Theory and Bayesian analysis.

=head2 UtilityFunction.pm6

method utilityf : E(P)[U(R)], for a single P (distribution) of rewards set R.

method utilityfunction(@ufs) : creates a utility over set P with this equal to E[U(r)]
where @ufs contains the distribution elements e.g. 
Game::Stats::DistributionPopulation.population's then returns the estimate.
This is a multiple reward system. This function is undocumented.

method three-rewards-solving-U3-alpha1($alpha1) and  
method three-rewards-solving-U3-alpha1($alpha2) : by calculating both
alphas one can derive both U(r3) where r1 << r3 << r2 (<< == is preferred over.)
U(r1) == 0 and U(r2) == 1 in this case.

=head3 StandardLossFunction.pm6

Figures several loss functions to be used for e.g. risk in games,
squared-error loss,  "0-1" loss and Bayesian loss (explicitly for "0-1" loss.)
